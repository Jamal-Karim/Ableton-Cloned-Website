        in 1999 and released the first version
        of Live in 2001. Our products are used by
        a community of dedicated musicians, sound
        designers, and artists from across the

        easy. It takes time, effort, and learning.
        But when you're in the flow, it's incredibly
        rewarding.</p>
        <p class="small-text">We feel the same way
        about making Ableton products.The driving
        force behind Ableton is our passion for
        what we make, and the people we make it

        divided between our headquarters in Berlin
        and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</p>
        <p class="small-text">Most of us are
        active musicians, producers, and DJs, 
        and many of us use Live and Push every day.
        We come from a wide range of cultural and 
        professional backgrounds. Some of us have 
        PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us 
        are somewhere in between. What connects us
        is the shared belief that each of us has the
        skills and knowledge to contribute to 
        something big: helping to shape the future 
        of music culture.</p>

        and we strive to make them great.</p>
        <p class="small-text">Rather than having 
        a one-size-fits-all process, we try to 
        give our people what they need to work 
        their magic and grow. We've learned that 
        achieving the best results comes from 
        building teams that are richly diverse, 
        and thus able to explore problems from a 
        wider set of perspectives. We don't always 
        agree with each other, but opinion and 
        debate are valued and openly encouraged.</p>

        internal training program, employees
        are actively supported in acquiring 
        new knowledge and skills, and coached on 
        applying these in their daily work. In 
        addition, staff-organized development and
        music salons are a chance to discuss new 
        technologies, production techniques and 
        best practices.</p>

        generous maternity and paternity leave. 
        Office hours are flexible, but it's not 
        all work; we have several company and
